				Hello, friend.

				<p>
				Iâ€™m Eugene, a software engineer based in Oakland, California. I love the creative process of turning abstract ideas into useful applications that people can use to make life easier, and envision a future where an increasingly digital world affords everyone more time to do the things they love.
				</p>
				<p>
				You'll find me on the hiking trail, in the yoga studio, or on the motorcycle most weekends.
